# Frontend UI Starter Project

This project serves as a starting point for spinning up a new frontend project using Vite, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and DaisyUI. It comes pre-configured with these tools, so you can focus on building your app instead of setting up the environment.

## Tools Used

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): A fast, opinionated build tool for modern web projects. [Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. [Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A superset of JavaScript that adds static types. [Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework. [Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)
- [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/): A component library for TailwindCSS. [Documentation](https://daisyui.com/docs/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

### Setting up degit

If you don't have `degit` installed, you can install it globally using npm:

```sh
npm install -g degit
```

### Cloning the Project

To clone this project without commit history, use `degit`:

```sh
degit github-user/repo-name my-new-project
cd my-new-project
```

### Installing Dependencies

Once you have cloned the project, install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```sh
npm start
```

This will start the Vite development server and you can view your application at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production

To build the project for production, run:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized build of your application in the `dist` directory.
